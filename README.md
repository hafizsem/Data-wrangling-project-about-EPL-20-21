# The Wrang-Maker: EPL 20-21 Data Wrangling Project

## 1. Assignment Overview

### 1.1 Description

Welcome to "The Wrang-Maker," our group project on Data Wrangling focusing on the football playerâ€™s performance in the previous season. The dataset used is "English Premier League (EPL) Player in 2021 statistics," obtained in CSV format from Kaggle. The Premier League is the English professional league for association football clubs. The dataset includes common attributes such as Name, Position, Appearances, and player performance statistics throughout the season. We performed various data preprocessing steps, including handling null values, converting nulls to zeros, and renaming rows.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Our goal is to predict player ratings in FIFA21 based on individual performance variables from the previous season. We use metrics like yellow and red cards, fouls, shots on target, offsides to assess team weaknesses. Additionally, we consider variables like goals, shooting accuracy, accurate long balls, and tackle success to gauge team strengths. These insights can assist coaches in finding rising stars, developing effective training plans, and mastering opponents' habits for strategic decisions.

### 1.3 Questions to Answer

We aim to answer key questions using the EPL Player statistics dataset:
- Who has the most fouls?
- Who is the top scorer?
- Who is the greatest goalkeeper?
- Who is the best midfielder?
- Who is the solid defender?
- Who is the top forward?

### 1.4 Objectives

Our objective is to forecast FIFA21 player ratings based on individual performances in the previous season and their ratings in the FIFA20 game. This project involves studying the Kaggle football dataset, analyzing data, extracting valuable information, and making predictions.

### 1.5 Data Description

The dataset contains 46,548 entries with 54 columns, including common attributes like Name, Position, Appearances, and player performance statistics throughout the season.
