1.1 Description of the assignment
The title of our assignment is The Wrang-Maker that discuss about the football player’s
performance in the previous season. In this assignment, the dataset used is “English Premier League
(EPL) Player in 2021 statistics” in the form of CSV file referred from Kaggel. In short brief, the Premier
League is an English professional league for association football clubs. The dataset has common
attributes i.e. Name, Position, Appearances, and the statistics of the player’s performance throughout
the season. Various data preprocessing steps were performed like omitting columns with too many null
values, exchanging the null values into zeros and renaming rows.
1.2 Problem to be solved
Using individual performance in the previous season to predict the rating of players,
some examples of variables used to determine the extent of the teams’ weaknesses such as
yellow and red cards served, fouls against the team, shots on target and offsides. For a list of
example variables that were used to determine the severity of the teams' strengths are goals,
shooting accuracy, accurate long balls and tackle success. With the given variables, it can be
used to track and predict sport performance of the athletes which can provide many advantages.
Examples of the advantages are it can help coaches find a rising star in sports, it can help
coaches and athletes to develop effective training plans or it can help coaches and athletes
master the opponent’s habits and specialties in the game to make value judgement in the game.
For example by analyzing each athlete’s recent game performance, the coach can make the
right decisions in selecting players for the game.
